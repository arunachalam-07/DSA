Recursion is calling the function again and again untill condition is satisfied.

There are types of recursion
1.Tail Recursion
2.Head Recursion
3.Tree Recursion
4.Indirect Recursion
5.Nested Recursion

during every function call recursion creates a activation record in memory once that function call ends it's work the activation record is erased from stack

runtime efficiency is based on number of calls

Space Efficiency is based on height of stack tree and number of branches in that trees

while comparing loops vs recursion loops are better than recursion   because loops take one unit of time while recursion takes n unit of time

some time recursion can be converted into loops but all the times it won't happen
